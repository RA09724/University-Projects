University Projects
This repository showcases a collection of projects and assignments completed as part of my Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Computer Science (Data Analytics) at APU.

1. Doctor Role Code (Hospital Management System)
Developed a comprehensive codebase for the doctor role within a Hospital Management System. This code facilitates patient management and scheduling, including functionalities for issuing e-diagnosis and handling patient care efficiently.

2. Group V Data Preparation
This script performs data cleaning on the credit risk classification dataset, ensuring the data is prepped and ready for analysis. It handles missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering to improve model performance.

3. Sarvein Rao TP071496 (Purpose & Credit Amount)
A continuation of the data preparation work, where I conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the credit risk dataset. This includes descriptive, predictive, diagnostic, and prescriptive analytics. I also implemented machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Linear Regression for classifying credit risks.

4. E-Library Database
Collaborated in a team to design and implement a relational database system for managing an e-library. The system covers key functionalities like book inventory management, user registrations, lending records, and overdue tracking.
